# Conditional Statement Syntax

# Remember when we showed you that whitespace in Python is significant? If not, write this down: whitespace in Python is significant. 
# If you've learned any JavaScript here on Codecademy, you know that the block of code an if statement 
# executes is bound by curly braces ({}). In Python, whitespace (tabs or spaces) does this work for us.

response = 'Y'

answer = "Left"
if answer == "Left":
    print "This is the Verbal Abuse Room, you heap of parrot droppings!"
    
# Will the above print statement print to the console?
# Set response to 'Y' if you think so, and 'N' if you think not.
